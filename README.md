# Bleak - AI Chatbot with Time Travel

A modern AI chatbot application built with FastAPI backend and React frontend, featuring LangGraph-powered conversation management and time travel capabilities.

## Features

### üöÄ Core Features

- **AI-Powered Conversations**: Intelligent chatbot using LangGraph for conversation flow
- **Real-time Chat Interface**: Modern, responsive chat UI with message history
- **Persistent Conversations**: Conversation state is maintained across sessions

### ‚è∞ Time Travel Features

- **Conversation History**: View complete conversation history with all checkpoints
- **Message Editing**: Edit any previous user message and see how the conversation would have evolved differently
- **Checkpoint Resume**: Jump back to any point in the conversation and continue from there
- **Visual Timeline**: See all conversation states with timestamps and navigation controls

## Time Travel Usage

### Viewing History

1. Start a conversation with the AI
2. Click the "Show History" button in the chat header
3. Browse through all conversation checkpoints with timestamps

### Editing Messages

1. In the history view, hover over any user message
2. Click the "Edit" button that appears
3. Modify the message and press Enter or click "Save"
4. The conversation will continue from that point with the new message

### Resuming from Checkpoints

1. In the history view, find the checkpoint you want to resume from
2. Click the "Resume Here" button
3. The conversation will continue from that exact state

### Keyboard Shortcuts

- **Enter**: Save edited message
- **Escape**: Cancel editing
- **Shift+Enter**: New line in edit mode

## Technical Implementation

### Backend (FastAPI + LangGraph)

- **Checkpoint System**: Uses LangGraph's MemorySaver for state persistence
- **Time Travel API**: RESTful endpoints for history management
- **State Management**: Conversation states are stored with unique checkpoint IDs

### Frontend (React + TypeScript)

- **Real-time Updates**: React Query for efficient data fetching and caching
- **Responsive Design**: Modern UI with Tailwind CSS
- **Interactive History**: Intuitive interface for browsing and editing conversation history

## API Endpoints

### Chat Endpoints

- `POST /chat` - Send a message to the chatbot
- `GET /chat/{conversation_id}/history` - Get conversation history with checkpoints
- `POST /chat/resume-from-checkpoint` - Resume conversation from a specific checkpoint
- `POST /chat/edit-message` - Edit a message at a specific checkpoint

### Health & Debug

## Architecture

The application follows the LangGraph time travel tutorial pattern:

- **State Persistence**: Every conversation step is checkpointed
- **Immutable History**: Previous states are preserved when editing
- **Branching Conversations**: Edits create new conversation branches
- **Efficient Storage**: Only state differences are stored between checkpoints
