# Continue a Conversation

Learn how to manage ongoing conversations with BleakAI using the `requestMoreBleakQuestions` method. This allows you to gather additional information when needed.

## When to Continue

Continue a conversation when:

- **You need more specificity**: Current answers aren't detailed enough
- **New questions arise**: User's answers reveal additional information needs
- **Conditional logic**: Certain answers trigger follow-up questions
- **Progressive disclosure**: Break complex forms into manageable steps

## Basic Usage

```typescript
const result = await bleak.requestMoreBleakQuestions(answers);

if (result.questions) {
  // More questions to ask
  const configs = bleak.resolveComponents(result.questions);
  // Render additional questions
} else if (result.isComplete) {
  // Ready to finish - no more questions needed
  const finalResult = await bleak.finishBleakConversation(answers);
}
```

## Method Signature

```typescript
requestMoreBleakQuestions(answers: Record<string, string>): Promise<BleakContinueResult>
```

### Parameters

- **answers** (`Record<string, string>`): Current answers collected from the user

### Return Type

```typescript
interface BleakContinueResult {
  questions?: BleakQuestion[]; // Additional questions (if any)
  isComplete: boolean; // Whether conversation is ready to finish
  suggestedAction?: string; // Optional guidance for next steps
}
```

## Decision Logic

BleakAI automatically determines whether to:

- **Generate more questions** if additional information would be helpful
- **Mark as complete** if enough information has been gathered
- **Provide suggestions** for the next best action

## Best Practices

1. **Check `isComplete` status** - Always verify if the conversation is ready to finish
2. **Handle both outcomes** - Be prepared for either more questions or completion
3. **Collect quality answers** - More detailed responses lead to better results
4. **Don't force continuation** - Trust BleakAI's completion assessment

## Error Handling

```typescript
try {
  const result = await bleak.requestMoreBleakQuestions(answers);
  // Handle result
} catch (error) {
  console.error("Failed to continue conversation:", error);
  // Handle error appropriately
}
```
