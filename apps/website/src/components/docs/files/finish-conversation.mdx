# Finish a Conversation

Learn how to complete conversations and get personalized final answers using the `finishBleakConversation` method. This is the culmination of your BleakAI interaction.

## When to Finish

Finish a conversation when:

- **All necessary information is collected**: You have enough data for a meaningful response
- **User requests completion**: User indicates they're ready for the final answer
- **Maximum questions reached**: You've gathered sufficient information
- **Time constraints**: User needs quick results

## Basic Usage

```typescript
const finalAnswer = await bleak.finishBleakConversation(answers);

// Display the personalized result
console.log("Final answer:", finalAnswer);
setResult(finalAnswer);
```

## Method Signature

```typescript
finishBleakConversation(answers: Record<string, string>): Promise<string>
```

### Parameters

- **answers** (`Record<string, string>`): All collected answers from the conversation

### Return Type

- **string**: The final personalized answer generated by BleakAI

## Answer Quality

For best results, ensure your answers are:

- **Complete**: All relevant questions have been answered
- **Detailed**: Provide sufficient context for meaningful recommendations
- **Accurate**: Double-check important information before finishing

## Error Handling

```typescript
try {
  const result = await bleak.finishBleakConversation(answers);
  // Handle final result
} catch (error) {
  console.error("Failed to finish conversation:", error);
  // Handle error appropriately
}
```

## Best Practices

1. **Validate critical answers** - Ensure important information is complete
2. **Provide user choice** - Let users decide when they're ready to finish
3. **Handle loading states** - Show progress while generating final answer
4. **Enable restart options** - Allow users to start new conversations
