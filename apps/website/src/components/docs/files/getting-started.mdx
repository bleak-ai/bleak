# Getting Started

Get up and running with BleakAI in just a few minutes. This guide will walk you through installation, API key setup, and basic configuration.

## Installation

Install the BleakAI library using your preferred package manager:

```bash
# Using npm
npm install bleakai

# Using yarn
yarn add bleakai

# Using pnpm
pnpm add bleakai
```

## Get Your API Key

To use BleakAI, you need an API key from [bleakai.com](https://bleakai.com):

1. **Visit [bleakai.com](https://bleakai.com)** and create an account
2. **Navigate to your dashboard** and generate a new API key
3. **Copy your API key** - you'll need it for configuration

### Why do I need an API key?

The API key authenticates your application with the BleakAI backend service. This allows:

- **Secure access** to the AI question generation service
- **Usage tracking** and billing management
- **Rate limiting** and abuse prevention
- **Personalized AI models** tailored to your use case

> **Security Note**: Keep your API key private. Never expose it in client-side code or public repositories. Use environment variables in production.

## Environment Setup

For security, store your API key in environment variables:

### `.env.local` (for Next.js)

```bash
BLEAK_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

### `.env` (for other frameworks)

```bash
REACT_APP_BLEAK_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
# or
VITE_BLEAK_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```
