# Bleak Overview

BleakAI is an intelligent form generation system that creates dynamic, conversational user interfaces. Instead of static forms, BleakAI generates context-aware questions that adapt based on user responses, creating a more engaging and efficient user experience.

## What is BleakAI?

BleakAI transforms the traditional form-filling experience by using artificial intelligence to:

- **Generate intelligent questions** based on your initial prompt
- **Adapt dynamically** to user responses
- **Use your existing UI components** for consistent design
- **Provide personalized final answers** based on collected data

Perfect for complex onboarding flows, surveys, recommendation systems, and any scenario where you need to collect user information intelligently.

## Architecture Components

BleakAI consists of three main components that work together seamlessly:

### 1. Your Frontend Application

This is your custom React, Vue, or Angular application where you:

- Design and implement your own UI components
- Control the visual styling and user experience
- Handle the overall application logic and routing

### 2. bleakai NPM Library

The open-source library that connects your frontend to BleakAI:

- **API Communication**: Handles all backend requests (`start`, `continue`, `finish`)
- **Component Resolution**: Maps backend questions to your UI components
- **Session Management**: Maintains conversation state and flow

### 3. BleakAI Backend

The private AI service that powers the intelligence:

- **Question Generation**: Creates contextual questions based on prompts
- **Answer Processing**: Analyzes user responses and determines next steps
- **AI Intelligence**: Provides final personalized answers

## Conversation Flow

A typical BleakAI conversation works in three phases:

1. **Start**: Send an initial prompt to begin the conversation
2. **Continue**: Collect user answers and request additional questions as needed
3. **Finish**: Process all answers and receive a personalized final response

## Key Benefits

- **Intelligent**: Questions adapt based on previous answers
- **Flexible**: Use your own UI components and design
- **Efficient**: Users only answer relevant questions
- **Scalable**: Backend handles the AI complexity
- **Open Source**: Frontend library is completely open
