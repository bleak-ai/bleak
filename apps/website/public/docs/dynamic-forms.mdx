# Dynamic Forms

Build interactive forms using your own components with AI-powered question generation.

## Overview

BleakAI generates smart questions based on user input and maps them to your existing components. You maintain full control over styling and behavior while BleakAI handles the conversational logic.

## Quick Start

1. **[Initialize Chat Client](dynamic-forms-initialize)** - Set up the BleakAI client
2. **[Create Custom Components](dynamic-forms-components)** - Map your components to question types
3. **[Ask Questions](dynamic-forms-questions)** - Start conversations and render questions
4. **[Send Answers](dynamic-forms-answers)** - Submit responses and get final results

## Basic Example

```typescript
// 1. Initialize
const client = createSimpleChatClient({
  baseUrl: "http://localhost:8000",
  apiKey: "your-bleakai-api-key",
  openaiKey: "your-openai-api-key"
});

// 2. Setup components
const {resolve} = createResolverFromConfig({
  text: {component: YourTextInput, description: "Text input"},
  radio: {component: YourRadioGroup, description: "Single choice"}
});

// 3. Start conversation
let response = await client.ask("Plan my vacation");

// 4. Handle questions
if (response.type === "questions") {
  const answers = await collectUserAnswers(response.questions);
  response = await client.answer(answers);
}

// 5. Display result
if (response.type === "answer") {
  displayResult(response.content);
}
```
