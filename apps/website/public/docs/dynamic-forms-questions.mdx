# Ask Questions

Start a conversation and render the AI-generated questions using your own components.

## Making a Request

Use the `ask` method to start a conversation. BleakAI analyzes your prompt and determines what information is needed:

```typescript
const response = await client.ask("Help me plan a vacation to Europe");
```

## Response Structure

BleakAI returns structured question data that you can render with your components:

```typescript
{
  type: "questions",
  questions: [
    {
      question_id: "q1",
      type: "radio",
      text: "What's your budget range?",
      options: ["$1000-2000", "$2000-5000", "$5000+"]
    },
    {
      question_id: "q2",
      type: "text",
      text: "How many days do you plan to travel?",
      options: null
    }
  ]
}
```

## Response Types

BleakAI can return different response types:

- **`questions`** - More information needed from the user
- **`answer`** - Final response ready to display
- **`complete`** - Conversation finished

## Rendering Questions

First, create your component resolver (see [Create Custom Components](dynamic-forms-components)):

```typescript
import {createResolverFromConfig} from "bleakai";

const config = {
  text: {component: YourTextInput, description: "Text input"},
  radio: {component: YourRadioComponent, description: "Single choice"},
  multiSelect: {component: YourMultiSelect, description: "Multiple choice"}
};

const {resolve} = createResolverFromConfig(config);
```

Then render questions using your components:

```typescript
if (response.type === "questions") {
  response.questions.forEach((question) => {
    const Component = resolve(question.type);

    return (
      <Component
        text={question.text}
        options={question.options}
        onChange={(value) => handleAnswer(question.question_id, value)}
      />
    );
  });
}
```

The `resolve` function returns the correct component for each question type, allowing you to maintain your design system while BleakAI handles the conversational logic.
