# Getting Started

Get up and running with BleakAI in just a few minutes.

## Installation

Install BleakAI using your preferred package manager:

```bash
npm install bleakai
```

```bash
yarn add bleakai
```

```bash
pnpm add bleakai
```

## API Key Setup

BleakAI requires an API key to access the conversational AI features.

### Getting Your API Key

Contact the BleakAI team to obtain your API key. Once you have it, configure it in your environment:

### Environment Configuration

Create a `.env.local` file in your project root:

```bash
# .env.local
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000
BLEAK_AI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
```

### Alternative: Direct Configuration

You can also pass the API key directly to the client:

```typescript
import {createSimpleChatClient} from "bleakai";

const client = createSimpleChatClient({
  baseUrl: "http://localhost:8000",
  apiKey: "your-api-key-here"
});
```

## Quick Start

Here's your first BleakAI conversation:

```typescript
import {createSimpleChatClient} from "bleakai";

// Initialize the client
const client = createSimpleChatClient({
  baseUrl: "http://localhost:8000",
  apiKey: "your-api-key"
});

// Start a conversation
const response = await client.ask("Help me plan a vacation");
console.log(response);
```
