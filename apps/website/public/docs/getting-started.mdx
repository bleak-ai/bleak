# Getting Started

Get up and running with BleakAI in just a few minutes.

## Installation

Install BleakAI using your preferred package manager:

```bash
npm install bleakai
```

## API Keys Setup

BleakAI requires two API keys to function properly:

### 1. BleakAI API Key (Beta)

The BleakAI API key is currently in beta mode. To get your API key:

1. Visit the BleakAI platform and log in to your account
2. Navigate to your dashboard to find your API key
3. Copy the API key for use in your application

### 2. OpenAI API Key

You'll also need an OpenAI API key for the AI functionality:

1. Visit [OpenAI's website](https://platform.openai.com/) and create an account
2. Go to the API section and generate your API key
3. Keep this key secure as you'll need it for configuration

### Environment Configuration

Create a `.env.local` file in your project root:

```bash
# .env.local
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000
BLEAK_AI_API_KEY=your-bleakai-api-key-here
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key-here
```

### Alternative: Direct Configuration

You can also pass the API keys directly to the client:

```typescript
import {createSimpleChatClient} from "bleakai";

const client = createSimpleChatClient({
  baseUrl: "http://localhost:8000",
  apiKey: "your-bleakai-api-key-here",
  openaiKey: "your-openai-api-key-here"
});
```

## Quick Start

Here's your first BleakAI conversation:

```typescript
import {createSimpleChatClient} from "bleakai";

// Initialize the client
const client = createSimpleChatClient({
  baseUrl: "http://localhost:8000",
  apiKey: "your-bleakai-api-key",
  openaiKey: "your-openai-api-key"
});

// Start a conversation
const response = await client.ask("Help me plan a vacation");
console.log(response);
```
