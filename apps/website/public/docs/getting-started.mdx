# Getting Started

Get up and running with BleakAI in just a few minutes.

## Installation

Install BleakAI using your preferred package manager:

```bash
npm install bleakai
```

## API Keys Setup

BleakAI requires two API keys to function properly:

### 1. BleakAI API Key (Beta)

The BleakAI API key is currently in beta mode. To get your API key:

1. Visit the BleakAI platform and log in to your account
2. Navigate to your dashboard to find your API key
3. Copy the API key for use in your application

### 2. OpenAI API Key

You'll also need an OpenAI API key for the AI functionality:

1. Visit [OpenAI's website](https://platform.openai.com/) and create an account
2. Go to the API section and generate your API key
3. Keep this key secure as you'll need it for configuration

## Configuration

Pass the API keys directly to the client when initializing:

```typescript
import {createSimpleChatClient} from "bleakai";

const client = createSimpleChatClient({
  baseUrl: "http://localhost:8000",
  apiKey: "your-bleakai-api-key-here",
  openaiKey: "your-openai-api-key-here"
});
```
