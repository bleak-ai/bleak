# Initialize Chat Client

Start by creating a chat client with the SDK to communicate with the BleakAI backend.

## Creating the Client

```typescript
import {createSimpleChatClient} from "bleakai";

const client = createSimpleChatClient({
  baseUrl: "http://localhost:8000",
  apiKey: "your-bleakai-api-key",
  openaiKey: "your-openai-api-key"
});
```

## Backend Architecture

The client handles communication with the BleakAI backend, which uses **LangGraph** to orchestrate sophisticated conversational flows with human-in-the-loop interactions.

The graph architecture consists of specialized nodes:

- **Clarify Node**: Generates contextual questions using LLM analysis
- **Structure Questions Node**: Converts natural language questions into structured UI component specifications
- **Choice Node**: Manages user decisions between requesting more questions or receiving final answers
- **Answer Node**: Produces comprehensive responses based on collected user input

LangGraph's state management and checkpoint system enables persistent conversations across multiple interactions, allowing users to progressively refine their queries through structured input collection.

## Client Configuration Options

```typescript
interface ClientConfig {
  baseUrl: string; // The BleakAI backend URL
  apiKey: string; // Your BleakAI API key (beta)
  openaiKey: string; // Your OpenAI API key
  timeout?: number; // Request timeout in milliseconds (default: 30000)
}
```

The client provides a clean interface to the powerful backend intelligence while maintaining simplicity for developers.
